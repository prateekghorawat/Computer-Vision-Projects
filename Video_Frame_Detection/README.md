#VIDEO CLASSIFICATION

Performed Classifcation (Multi Class) on HMDB51_ORG dataset , which is a collection of Videos on 51 Classes. 

## Overview

In this project, I developed a video classification model using PyTorch. The goal was to achieve high accuracy in classifying videos into different categories.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing demand for efficient video classification models in real-world applications. Video analysis has become crucial in various domains, including surveillance, healthcare, and entertainment. Developing a robust model capable of accurate classification opens up opportunities for automation and enhanced decision-making processes.

## Key Achievements

- **Accuracy:** Achieved an impressive accuracy of 87.2% on the test dataset.

- **Skills Gained:**
  - Data preprocessing and splitting using Python and myutils module.
  - Implementation of a custom dataset class for video data.
  - Definition of a deep learning model (choose either 3DCNN or RNN).
  - Training and evaluation of the model using PyTorch.
  - Model deployment and usage for real-world applications.

## Real-World Applications

The video classification model developed in this project has the potential for various real-world applications, including:

1. **Surveillance Systems:**
   - Enhance security systems by automatically categorizing and alerting based on video content.

2. **Healthcare:**
   - Aid in patient monitoring by analyzing video data for signs of distress or specific health conditions.

3. **Entertainment Industry:**
   - Automate the categorization of video content for better content recommendation systems.

4. **Industrial Automation:**
   - Assist in quality control by analyzing video streams for defects in manufacturing processes.
